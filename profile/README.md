# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome! We are a group of people making software related to the [Bedrock Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock_Edition) of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft)

## ðŸª£ Stack

Most of you know that [Java Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition) uses well, the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) programming language,
and *some* of you also know that Bedrock Edition uses [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) instead of Java.

Well, we don't care, most things made by us use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) with the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language. and some of you probably asked **why?**,
well, the answer is simple, Java has clunky syntax and is somewhat hard to use, C++ is too low level for our scope *and brains*, so we chose typescript and bun :D

If you really need/want to contact us, for now you can dm me (the founder) on discord: [@andriemc](https://discord.com/users/662912619975278592),
but we're planning to open a discord server and google group so that it's easier for you :)
