# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome! We are a group of people making software related to the [Bedrock Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock_Edition) of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft)

Most of you know that [Java Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition) uses well, the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) programming language,
and *some* of you also know that Bedrock Edition uses [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) instead of Java.

well, we're using Java for most of our projects. **Why?**, well C++ is way too low level for our scope *and brains*, and for some odd reason I like java...
